        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>I am Learning Enthusiast, Educator, IT professional, Food Blogger, Classical Dancer,Spritual person.<br>
            I love reading, writing, spending time with nature in the midst of sunshine and rain. I love reading Bhawat Gita. 
            It is like the fuel for the soul to understand life and its phases in a very clear manner.
        These spiritual rituals and books provide a clear path and wisdom to understand the life and people.
         It clearly depicts the way things are happening and reason behind the same. 
        The pattern of thoughts, manifestations, perceptions and way of thinking entirely depends on the knowledge you are consuming. Would like to share some knowledge so that any person can get little help via reading. And not suffer the same.
       Would like to share an instance, like these days there are many options to spend your time mindlessly with Add on Internet packs and new channels .
        If you mindlessly watch the wrongful web series,or tv which displays nothing but only from the view point of the person who is creating it.
        If they like the person in the storyframe or character, they will make them look good.
       And viceversa, they are going to potray them in  a negative image.
        Its entirely the thoughts, perception of the person behind the series(story writer, author) who creates it to convey a good message or a carefully manipluated cruel rude message via this medium.
         If that, same event would have happened with  the person writng the script or creator, they will never display themselves as wrong.
        Instead they will take the place of the character who was right and make their target look like the vamp in the show 
        by interchanging the images and characters.
         Inspite the reality being completely opposite. Its a hard fact to digest but people do the the things for the sake of their own benefit. 
         Once you watch the webseries, you start to link the character and story and it will be entirely half truth told by the story writer or dialouges or action drama,
         which was shown and half which was understood on the basis of your thinking capacity.
        It is not right to judge a person on the basis of what you have heard from someone  because ,
         it is half truth served by verbal twist and the other half which is hidden is only with the person who created the web series or the story and the one who actually suffered. 
     The story was  manipluated or twisted carefully in order to potray abuser  as good. No matter how ugly , sinful,evil they are in real life. 
    They take the pleasure by destroying someone life to the extent just for their greedness, lustiness and false egosit pleasure, in order to feel powerful and superior.
   They are jealous by nature, feel insecure and inferior when in fact they want to become like the person who is possessing all the good qualities and deeds.
 They want to become like them by snatching away their trueselves and potrying the good souls as bad as conveniently as per their wrong imagination and wrong interpretation of the  situation.
     Due to this jealousy only,  people tend to become narcissist. Narcissist are real monsters and sucker of the happiness. They want to snatch away the reason of your happiness & existence 
     and want to see every one in pain and suffering.

     And deep down they are only thinking to take revenge and false pleasures. They always target your strengths and potray them as weakness infront of the world,
    so that they can hide their own evil deeds, destructions, assualt, abuse carefully and shift the blame game.
     They are like cancer to the soul. No not talking about the disease still it is curable to an extent with the latest technology. But, they take the life out of you when you are still alive.
     Narcissict are uncontrolled , untamed, atheist, arrogant, drug addict evil for which their is no cure yet. Only cure is to send them hell in Mental Hospital in Alwar District or Agra. 
     They are psychopaths. Also make your life hell. No matter whatever you do or say in life they are going to interfere and then speak with evil intentions and want to control. 
     Their whole game lies in power and control and if you deny them then you are the target of the narcissictic person. By hook or crook they will follow you endlessly and 
     bribe other people to get your details and secrets, daily life struggles  so that they can still show that they can control you, manipluate you, and feel superior in doing the same to make you feel vurnerable.
     I wish there could have been a instrument or scientifc research where we could detect the real intention of narcissist even before meeting the damn bastard, sinful person,evil mind. 
     They say AI is the key but in research there is no fool proof evidence as of now, they again change and play with the results of the scientist.
    So that, no one has to become the target to fuel the narcissictic ego and taking pride by creating false image by making victim look inferior.
    They take revenges, with the innocent targets, which one cant even image and it is very difficult to interpret their cruel intentions in the first place.
  Also, in history there have been several attempt to prove it but either the succesful people have been bribed or compromised with the lives when they try to speak the truth to help the humanity as Life is in danger.
  And if the truth comes out, someone can think of ways to protect the civilisation and the kill the evil. 
  
  So here, Bhagwat gita tells us, the person doing the work with the good intentions then their bad can be ignored. 
  But, if the person is mindfully cheating on someone, also planned evil tricks and plotted to destroy the life just to fulfill their revenge ,
  then it should never be ignored and will be punished by lord,  if not in the life then after death they need to suffer the hells in course of time.
   Also,  if still they do not stop doing  the evil deeds against the innocent people they should be afraid of lord who is the powerful creator of Universe 
   watching over them to warn them by little warnings like leg injury, tooth decay etc.
      One can attain a lot of wisdom and knowledge to analyse the life and the birth cycle. 
      Life in itself is the ultimate creation of lord and no one still knows how the universe works. 
    We have heard stories, we have read journals, and we have learned about facts from various researches but there is still no evidence. 
    Only truth is there is one Supereme powerful who has created this Universe and way the Sun rises and sets without any break. 
    The seasons chane, the weather changes, the time changes, the life changes.
     It brings the peace which gets lost in the midst of daily life struggles and the whole chaos of negativity and destruction and hurt and pain in and around the world.
    When we hear news, or  switch on other channels or even flipping the pages of newspaper, these days all we can see is the crisis and tragedy.
    So in order to get back the balance, it is essential to keep yourself healthy and happy to face the struggles and divert the mind and do prayers.
    We must endure all the phases of life with open arms and never ever regret for the ups and down of life. We must treat them as a part and parcel of life. 
    Yes, sometimes for sure it feels like the burden is too much but as long as the Superpower is there to hold on your life.
    You should not get disturbed by little  hardships or setbacks.
    Life is a blessing and every day comes with lot of opportunities! Cease them!! Stay Blessed!! Stay Healthy!!!
